# Introduction {#sec-intro}

This brief chapter introduces the concept of econometrics by explaining what it is, who uses it, and how it connects to other disciplines, setting the stage for why it is such a valuable set of tools in both economics and disciplines beyond. It also provides an overview of the book, outlining its focus on applied econometrics and what you can expect to learn. By the end of this short chapter, you will have a clearer understanding of the role econometrics plays in analyzing data, answering questions, and informing decisions, as well as how this book will guide you through its practical application using R.

## What is Econometrics?

**Econometrics** is the branch of economics that applies statistics to economic theory. Since statistics is a sub-discipline of mathematics, some math is unavoidable in econometrics. However, the emphasis of this book is not *econometric theory* but rather it is on *applied econometrics*. Our focus will be more on the application of econometric techniques and the interpretation of econometric results, rather than delving deeply into the mathematical underpinnings of the subject. That said, it is assumed that your level of mathematical understanding is at least equivalent to having taken a college algebra and an introductory statistics course.

Less mathy does not necessarily mean easier. While the theoretical underpinning of econometrics are found in calculus, linear algebra, and probability theory, the application of econometrics requires at least an intuitive understanding of the math and a solid grasp of computer coding and programming skills. In short, while this text will attempt to keep the explicit use of calculus and linear algebra to a minimum, to successfully *do* econometrics will require us to focus heavily on learning basic programming skills using the R language.

In many ways, my goal is to see how far I can help you push your econometric and statistical intuition without resorting to "doing the math." Which means that, if, after working through this book, you want to dig deeper into these topics, you probably won't get very far without also augmenting your math skills. 

## Overview of the Book

Before getting into econometrics, we will start with the basics. The next chapter features an introduction to the R language and the RStudio programming environment. After that, we continue to build our statistical computing skills by learning about data wrangling using the Tidyverse in @sec-wrangling and literate programming using Quarto in @sec-litprog. Finally, we use R to do many of the things it is already assumed you know how to do using other methods; for example, calculating descriptive statistics and making graphs (@sec-basicstats), and conducting basic inferential statistics (e.g. hypothesis testing, ANOVA) in @sec-inferstats. In many ways, this first section of the text is designed to teach you the programming basics needed for this book by showing you how to use R to accomplish tasks that (I hope!) you already know how to do.

From there, we transition into a study of econometrics itself, beginning with the fundamental building block: ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. OLS will be introduced in @sec-basicreg and extended in @sec-assumptions and @sec-categoricalIV. OLS regression will create our basis for understanding to tackle more sophisticated methods, like probit/logit modeling in @sec-categoricalDV, time series in @sec-timeseries, and myriad other advanced techniques found in the latter half of the book.

The fundamental methods of OLS, probit/logit, and time series are not only key tools in economics, but are key tools across a wide variety of disciplines throughout the social sciences, hard sciences, and quantitative areas of business. While people in these areas may be using these techniques for slightly different purposes, or may call them by different names, at the end of the day, developing an understanding of these techniques provides you with a versatile skillset that is useful in a wide variety of contexts well beyond academic economics.

If at any point you find yourself stuck or wanting to go further, the final chapter, @sec-nextsteps, includes a curated list of excellent texts and books. These resources can guide you toward mastering more advanced econometric techniques, programming skills, and contemporary topics in econometrics, analytics, and visualization.

## A Word About AI Tools

I want to warn you now: the learning curve for this stuff can be pretty steep, and it is natural to feel frustrated or overwhelmed early on when learning econometrics and R. However, I want to strongly urge you to resist the temptation turn to an AI to do the heavy lifting for you before you have built the foundation upon which to understand both what AI is doing, and why it is doing it. While tools like ChatGPT or other code-generating AI can seem like a quick solution, relying on them too early can short-circuit the learning process. You may get code that works, but without knowing why or how it works, you won’t develop the deeper understanding of econometric concepts and R programming that this book aims to teach. Worse, you may get code that produces a result that is nonsensical, but lack the understanding to identify or correct it.

AI can be a powerful tool, but used incorrectly it is an impediment to learning. If you skip the hard work of grappling with the material yourself—writing code, fixing errors, and thinking through problems—you will likely become overly dependent on AI-generated answers and miss out on the skills that make you truly capable. At its core, econometrics is about understanding data, interpreting results, and drawing conclusions—skills that require a strong foundation in both the theory and the application. If you don’t take the time to develop that foundation, you won’t be able to evaluate whether AI’s output is correct, appropriate, or meaningful, which can lead to mistakes that are easy to miss and difficult to correct.

## Final Thoughts

If you invest the time needed to work through this book, you should not only have developed a solid intuition of econometric and statistical techniques, but also the practical skills to apply them using R. Whether you pursue work in economics, finance, business analytics, or anything else grounded in quantitative reasoning, these tools will give you a solid foundation for making sense of data. And who knows-maybe you'll have some fun along the way?
