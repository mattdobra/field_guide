Notes:

Hi Matt,

I am writing to say how great I think your econometrics book is (https://bookdown.org/mattdobra/Prelude/intro.html). I noticed your request in the beginning to get in touch if you read the book. I just came across it on google (when looking for examples of censoring actually).

I think the book is really excellent, the way R programming is integrated and econometrics is taught without too much technical detail is perfect. I am teaching a course called Economic Analysis of Data this semester and a textbook like this would have been a great fit. I only wish I had found out about your book earlier as I would have built the entire course around using it! 

For the future, is it ok to use this book as a textbook in my course? I would of course give proper credit in the syllabus (or in any other way you would prefer). 

Best,

Doug
